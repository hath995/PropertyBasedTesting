/*
 * In a particular board game, players have to try to advance through a sequence of positions. 
 * Each position has a nonnegative integer associated with it, representing the maximum you can advance from that position in one move. For example, let A = [3,3,1,0,2,0,1] represent the board game i.e. the i-th entry in A is the maximum we can advance from i. If A = [3,2,0,0,2,0,1] it is not possible to advance past position 3
 *
 * Write a function which takes an array of n integers, where A[i] denotes the maximum you can advance from the index i, and returns whether is is possible (true, false) to advance to the last index starting from the beginning of the array
